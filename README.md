# Kruza
Kruza is a blockchain-powered platform that tracks paddy from farmers to consumers. Farmers deliver crops to hubs, which coordinate milling, packaging, and distribution. QR codes and smart contracts ensure transparency, traceability, and fair, automatic payments directly to farmers, protecting them from middlemen.
